# Project A - GetFriended Social Media Web App

### Use Git or GitHub Desktop to publish branches/commit changes
### Enable routing and non-strict mode to all projects

```
Social Media App

I want to create the next Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. I need your help! 

We want to make a social media application that allows people to post their statuses and add other people as their friends.

We would like people to view their friends posts in their homepage as well as their own. It would also be nice to allow users to have their own profile and see all of their posts.

It would be great when you add a friend, a modal pops up with "You added {name}"!

Adding login and sign up functionality would be great! That means a login/sign up page.

A user should have an email, password and ID.

A post should have user id belonging to the user who created it and a description.

Additional featurs I like would be: 

A user would be able to unfriend a friend.

A post can have likes and dislikes!

#### Design 
https://www.figma.com/file/PMxjIII4uKkPEtWJLxmh1n/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1


Create an MVP first without diving into additional features
- MVP stands for Minimal Viable Product. Althought this application has a couple of features, start off with the baseline of the project and then work your way up into adding additional features


# MVP Task Breakdown

Create the home page feature.

Task 1. Create the project and install necessary frameworks/technologies(Bootstrap)

Task 2: Create a navbar with the following navlinks corresponding to the home page shown in the figma design.

Task 3: Create a button that allows you to create a post. When the user clicks the button, show a modal that contains a form. Be able to create a post with that form. The form should only include one field and that is a description. 

Task 4: Each time you post something, you should see it in your homepage shown in the design.
